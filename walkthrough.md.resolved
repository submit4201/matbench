# Walkthrough - Event Models Phase 2

## Changes
Refined and expanded event models in `src/models/events/` based on user feedback and CSV requirements.

### New Files
- **`commerce.py`**: Supply Chain, Vendor, and Business events.
- **`finance.py`**: Transactions, Bills, Taxes, Loans, Real Estate.
- **`social.py`**: Legal, Scandals, Dilemmas, Relationships, Alliances, Communication.
- **`operations.py`**: Machines, Staff, Customers, Tickets, R&D, Marketing.
- **`world.py`**: Time, Weather, Market Trends.

### Deleted Files
- `hr.py` (Merged into `operations.py`)
- `simulation.py` (Split into `world.py` and `operations.py`)

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
Ran `pytest .test/src/models/events/test_events.py`.
- **Result**: PASSED
- **Coverage**: Verified instantiation of representative events from all 5 domains (`OrderPlaced`, `FundsTransferred`, `ScandalStarted`, `StaffHired`, `TimeAdvanced`).

### Design Compliance
- **Immutability**: All events inherit from `GameEvent` which is frozen.
- **Granularity**: Staff events exploded to `Hired`, `Fired`, `Quits`, `Trained`.
- **Environment**: World events separated from player operations.
- **Completeness**: Mapped all CSV events to Pydantic models.
